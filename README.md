Design mix plays a crucial role in construction projects, and it is essential to optimize the mix to achieve the desired properties while remaining cost-effective. However, the traditional trial-and-error approach for mix optimization can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this, machine learning can be leveraged by utilizing existing data sets to provide a solution that offers both cost savings and high-quality concrete. The main objective is to obtain a safe design mix that minimizes expenses while meeting specific requirements and constraints. This approach facilitates the achievement of desired properties by utilizing available information and constraints.
In script, the compressive strength of concrete is predicted for any given mix design.
